Experience, people --- as a driver, if I had all the money in the world I would've picked Melling over everything. They were fun people, they were a good team. When you get to a top team, you're there to make them look good and win, and that's a lot of pressure. It's funny, with me, when I first went to test for Hendrick, we tested at St. Louis and we were amazing there.\nHowever, I think I was better with a team that was struggling and I could carry them. With a big team, I was expected to win, and I think that placed a bit too much pressure on me. I wanted to do good, and when I didn't do good, I just couldn't accept my teammates beating me. I got upset and frustrated, and I should've just been happy to be there. Maybe I was meant to be with a mediocre team, and help them build it. I never had a real good home, I tried my best, but I just put too much pressure on myself at Hendrick. I wish I had somebody to give me guidance so I wasn't doing it on my own. I would take the guys out to lunch at Hendrick --- you wouldn't see that from Terry or Jeff Gordon, but maybe I just wasn't meant to be there at Hendrick. Going back to what Dale Jr. said, I was just thrown to the wolves.\nWhen Dale Jr. was interviewing me and he said he knew what I was going through --- well, no he doesn't really. You're the son of the greatest driver, and I'm the son of Jerry Nadeau from Connecticut. Nobody is the same, it's a struggle, it's tough, I wanted it, but I wasn't ready for it.

[0] Sponsored Links The GMC Hummer EV combines cutting-edge technology with rough-and-ready specs to dominate in the dirt. One of the coolest onboard features is CrabWalk mode , and now, we’re watching as the new Hummer EV does a little sideways crab walking down Woodward Avenue. Captured at the recent 26th annual Woodward Dream Cruise in Detroit, Michigan, a convoy of GMC Hummer EVs showed up to show off the wild new feature. The video includes a compilation of amateur clips that show the new battery-powered off-roaders moving sideways through traffic, much to the amusement of folks watching from the sidewalk. For those that don’t know, the Hummer EV CrabWalk mode utilizes the off-roader’s four-wheel steering system to move the rear wheels in unison with the front wheels. With CrabWalk engaged, the vehicle will move diagonally, rather than circularly. This feature is great for plying the trails, as it allows the Hummer EV to more deftly maneuver around obstacles that would otherwise block its path. The feature could also be used in an urban environment, for example, moving into a tight parking spot. Alternatively, one could use it simply to wow onlookers, such as in this video. Interestingly, the convoy of GMC Hummer EV models includes not only vehicles decked out in production-spec body pieces, but also a few examples in prototype guise with missing fender flares, non-production fascia treatments, and non-production lighting features. The GMC Hummer EV reintroduces the legendary Hummer nameplate as an all-new, all-electric off-roader, with multiple options offered for performance and powertrain specs. The range-topper mounts three electric motors good for more than 1,000 horsepower and “ 11,500 ” pound-feet of torque, propelling the vehicle to 60 mph in roughly 3 seconds. Under the skin, the Hummer EV rides on the GM BT1 platform. Production is set to take place at the GM Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly facility , now known as Factory Zero , in Michigan.

If it’s not news that the value of Bitcoin has reached a record high of $60,000 (€50,500) for the first time, it’s news that Tesla founder Elon Musk is investing billions in it. While buying and selling cryptos is becoming increasingly mainstream, the opportunities to spend virtual currencies are somewhat limited in comparison due to its volatility. There are, however, a growing number of companies across a plethora of industries – from big tech to airlines – who are embracing cryptocurrencies, allowing customers to use them as an official method of payment for their goods and services. Here are some of the biggest and more well-known companies using and accepting cryptos. Pavilion Hotels & Resorts The Hong Kong-based Pavilion Hotels & Resorts group has also become the first international hotel chain to embrace virtual currency payments. The group – which owns properties in Amsterdam, Madrid, Lisbon, and Rome as well as Bali and Phuket – will accept bookings using 40 different tokens, including Bitcoin and Ethereum from July through their partnership with payment platform Coindirect. AXA Insurance As of the start of April, the insurance broker behemoth will allow customers in Switzerland to use Bitcoin as a payment option for their bills. The decision to embrace cryptocurrencies has been in the pipeline since market research conducted by the company in 2019 found that nearly a third of respondents aged 18 to 55 had either already invested in them or were interested in doing so. Customers will now have a reference code printed on bills for non-life insurance policies in order to pay their premiums through crypto exchange Bitcoin Suisse which will then convert them into Swiss Francs. Microsoft As one of the largest software companies in the world, it is significant that Microsoft accepts Bitcoin payments, going some way to instill a degree of confidence in using cryptos. Redeemed for credit in topping up user accounts, Bitcoin can be used to pay for an array of services, including Xbox Live and Skype. The company’s interest in crypto technology doesn’t end there. Utilising blockchain, Microsoft has also launched ION, a two-layered authentication platform on the Bitcoin network in late March. Instead of payments, the technology creates digital IDs to authenticate online identities. Starbucks Following an extensive trial, Starbucks customers can now use the new Bakkt app to pay for drinks and goods at the coffee chain with converted Bitcoin. According to the app’s creators, 500,000 people took up the invitation-only, early access programme to test the digital wallet as a method of payment. Tesla The CEO of electric carmaker Tesla Elon Musk has an up and down relationship with Bitcoin. Initially, the company announced earlier this year that it would accept Bitcoin payments for vehicle purchases in the US. It comes off the back of a $1.5 billion (€1.2 billion) investment in the cryptocurrency by Elon Musk’s company in February. However, this has now been turned on its head with pronouncements that Tesla will put Bitcoin transactions on hold until more than 50 per cent of tokens are mined using renewable energy. Amazon It was reported earlier this year that Amazon was joining the ranks of other tech giants, including Facebook, in laying the groundwork for its own exclusive cryptocurrency. That said, the e-commerce company doesn’t directly accept cryptos yet. You can, however, buy Amazon vouchers through crypto-only company Bitrefill, a platform that makes living on cryptocurrencies easier by converting Bitcoin into gift cards, refill phones, and so on. Visa Credit card company Visa confirmed at the end of March that it was piloting a scheme with platform Crypto.com to accept cryptocurrency to settle transactions on its payment network. It will now accept USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin crypto that is pegged to the value of the US dollar. PayPal Following an announcement in October last year, PayPal users in the US can now buy, sell or hold a select few cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. In addition, you’ll be able to track cryptocurrencies through the PayPal app. The only drawback is that money can’t be transferred out of the company’s digital wallet. In August, the company announced that users in the UK can now also trade in Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on PayPal’s website and mobile app. So far, PayPal is tight-lipped about whether it intends to expand the service to other countries.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","external_links":[],"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"elon musk","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"ju","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"crypto","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"tesla","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"pavilion hotels & resorts","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"rome","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bali","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"amsterdam","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"madrid","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"lisbon","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"phuket","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"hong kong-based","sentiment":"none"}]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2021-08-30T22:01:21.017+03:00","updated":"2021-08-30T22:01:21.017+03:00"}

In 2017, Tequila trade body the Consejo Regulador del Tequila (CRT) launched two lawsuits against Dutch firm Heineken in Nanterre, France, and Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, over the latter’s ‘improper and unauthorised’ use of the word ‘Tequila’ on its Desperados brand. The brand claims it is flavoured with Tequila on its label, and that it contains an ‘aroma’ of 75% Tequila among its ingredients. At the start of 2020, the CRT said it had received ‘reliable evidence demonstrating Tequila adulteration’, whereby a liquid is modified to turn it into a flavour. Heineken brews the beer by adding 0.14% of ‘Tequila flavouring’, the CRT noted. However, the flavouring is composed of 75% Tequila in addition to other ingredients. The CRT said this misleads the consumer. The CRT said Heineken’s product goes against a ruling from the European Commission (EC) thatrecognised Tequila as a geographical indication (GI) in 2019, making it the first Mexican product to have the highest standard of protection in Europe. The French lawsuit ruled in favour of Tequila. Additionally, the trade body said it had appealed against a decision in Amsterdam. To allow Heineken to use the protected name of Tequila in beer, the product must be made up of 25% Tequila in line with European Union (EU) regulations, the CRT told The Spirits Business earlier this year. ‘Beneficial’ agreement In a joint statement, the CRT and Heineken confirmed that they had “amicably” settled the legal dispute, but its terms have not been disclosed. The statement read: “The agreement is beneficial to both parties and to the geographical indication Tequila and to Desperados. The terms of the agreement remain confidential. “The appeal court case was pending since 2019, and the agreement will be ratified by the Amsterdam court of appeal. The strong protection of the denomination Tequila, existing since 1997, has recently been further enhanced after it was recognised as an EU geographical indication under the relevant EU regulation. Any production of Tequila shall be in compliance with the Tequila standard.” © 2021 Union Press Ltd | Wigglesworth House, Fourth Floor, 69 Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 9HH, UK Tel: +44 (0)20 7803 2420 Registered in England and Wales No. 03606414 Site by Redwire It looks like you're in Asia, would you like to be redirected to the Drinks Business Asia edition?
